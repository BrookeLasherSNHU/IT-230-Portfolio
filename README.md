# Reflection
The application needed to allow the user to choose up to 9 credits worth of courses from a list of courses, with each course being worth 3 credits. I feel like my use of setters and getters was something I did particularly well for this application, as it prevented some boilerplate code which would have only grown if the application were to be expanded. My UI design was simple enough to be used by anyone, and the errors were human-readable, ensuring that if someone were to input incorrect data, they would know what was incorrect about it. To code the application, I had to look within the given UI code to find out what to name my functions so that they could be used by the UI. I had to innovate in Project II by creating the setter for the Total Credit Hours, because otherwise every time I changed the total credit hours I would have to update the text box separately; however, by creating a SetCreditHours() function and assigning it to TotalCreditHours' getter, I was able to avoid having to write repetitive code.
